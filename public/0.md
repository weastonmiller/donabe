Donabe (doh-NAH-bay) is Japanese traditional earthen cookware. The Kanji characters that make up the word mean "clay pot": do (土) is "clay" or "earth," and nabe (鍋) is "pot".

Donabe-ware is versatile: you can use it for a hot pot, soup, stew, for steaming fish or vegetables, making rice, or even grilling! Donabe cookware shouldn't be reserved for special occasions; it's designed for everyday cooking.

All of our donabe products are hand-crafted by Nagatani-En in Iga, Japan. You can find more information about the pottery of Iga (Iga-Yaki) and Nagatani-En below.

## The Art of Imperfection

Iga-yaki (伊賀焼), or pottery from Iga, Japan are truly one-of-a-kind works of art; each piece is hand-crafted by skilled artisans and, as a result, the shape, color, and patterns are slightly different from one another-- this is the beauty called wabi-sabi, something you will not get from products made by machine.

Pottery is one of Japan's most highly-regarded crafts. The Iga region, where the clay is sourced, was once the bed of Lake Biwa about 4 million years ago. Nagatani-en, the family owned producer where we source our beautiful ceramics, has been making authentic Iga-yaki pottery since 1832. Each piece produced by Nagatani-en goes through multiple strict quality checks at the property before it is released to the market, so that quality is guaranteed. Once the products arrive in our shop from Iga, Japan, we inspect each piece at our Los Angeles store before we put it on our shelves to sell.

We take immense pride to passionately deliver the highest caliber of Japanese products and goods to our customers. As such, we would like you, our customers, to hold the same appreciation for these products and invest in taking care of them. We hope you enjoy not only the products, but the attention to detail, and love in each one of our items.

###### Subtitle explaining something about this picture

The Japanese philosophy meaning “one time, one meeting”. We approach each interaction with true sincerity and treasure it as if it were the last. As a pottery producer, Nagatani-en makes donabe with special attention to the uniqueness that is inherent in every piece because this phenomenon can only occur once-in-a-lifetime. These rare experiences can never be replicated and that is the beauty of it.
